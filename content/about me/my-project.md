My name is Liam Black and I am currently a third year student at Allegheny College. I am a Computer Science Major, and a Psychology Minor. When it comes to the technical side of me I am currently interested in pursuing the data analytics field. I'd like to be apart of research that focuses on the social and ethical impacts of data on different societies. I have experience using R programming to create plots and tables to  analyze data sets. My future goal is to secure a data analytics internship where I can get first hand expereince using and plotting data and seeing how companies efficiently use people's data for their buisness.
