My name is Liam Black and I am currently a third year student at Allegheny College. I am a Computer Science Major, and a Psychology Minor. When it comes to the technical side of me  I am open to most fields in Computer Science I am currently interested in pursuing Data Analytics and getting first hand experience in that. What interests me is the social and ethical impacts of data anywhere from small scale to large. I have experience using R programming to create plots and tables to assist me in analyzing data sets. My future goal is to secure a data analytics internship where I can get first hand expereince using and plotting data and seeing how companies use people's data.

On the non-techincal side, I am a dual citizen in Italy and America, who loves to travel, go to museums, play sports, and listen to music. I am on the frisbee club team at allegheny and enjoy competitng in tournaments with my teamates.
