My name is Liam Black and I am currently a third year student at Allegheny College. I am a Computer Science Major, and a Psychology Minor. When it comes to the technical side of me I am currently interested in pursuing the data analytics field. I'd like to be apart of research that focuses on the social and ethical impacts of data on different societies. I have experience using R programming and SQLite to create plots and tables to  answer queries. My future goal is to secure a data analytics internship where I can get first hand expereince using and plotting data and seeing how companies efficiently use people's data for their buisness.

On the non-techincal side, I love to travel, I am a dual citizen in America and Italy from my grandmother. I enjoy to museums, playing sports and video games, and listening to music. I am on the frisbee club team at allegheny and compete in tournaments against other Division-3 schools.
