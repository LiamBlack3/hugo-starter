## Data Analytics Final Project

You can find the current release on [Github](https://github.com/LiamBlack3/Data-Analytics-Final-Project)!

This project looks at public health indicators from countries around the world and answers research questions asking about the correlation between indicators.

This project utilized Rstudio to create statistical models and plots to explore correlations between varaibles such as knowledge of contraception vs. fertility rates. These data findings discovered conclusions about the discrepencies between developing and developed countries.
