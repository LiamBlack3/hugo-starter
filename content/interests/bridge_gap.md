#### Questions
Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.

1. Summarize the knowledge gap that emerges from your chosen research area.

2. How do you know that a gap exists? How does relevant literature motivate or provide justification to the completion of the gap? Identify at least four research articles or other materials which identify the gap. Please include four references in this discussion. Note: it is entirely likely that new references may need to be discovered for this discussion.

One of the biggest gaps in data analytics looking from research is how companies chose to use, distribute, and protect user data. When you think of private data, like location based data it is important to protect that information but also still using it for the function of the product. Take for example the application, Pokemon Go, this app relies on gps location data for it to function correctly, but at the same time, who gets to see each persosn location. Surely we would want to protect that from cyber attacks. 

3. State and introduce at least one research question that, when answered, will fill the knowledge gap.

 How do we as data analysts use our customers data in an ethical way?

4. Broadly, describe the steps that you will take to answer the research question(s), and fill the knowledge gap.

 One way to attack this research question would be look at some of the biggest secutiry problems with applications, and why there is a privacy problem and what measures, or lack of were the cause of the breach.
