## Data Analytics and SQL

My area of excitement at the moment is in the field of data analytics. Specifically learning SQL and all its features is what is peaking my interest. Learning how to import data sets and put them into a table, and then being able to pick out elements from the tables and answer querries on them. At the moment I have been importing data sets assigned in class but it would be cool to import one of my choosing from an area such as player statistics and analyze it by my own choosing.
