## Data Analytics and SQL

My area of excitement at the moment is in the field of data analytics. Specifically learning SQL and all its features is what is peaking my interest. Learning how to import data sets and put them into a table, and then being able to pick out elements from the tables and answer queries on them. At the moment I have been importing data sets assigned in class but it would be cool to import one of my choosing from an area such as player statistics and analyze it by my own choosing. Another area of interest inside the SQL language I would like to explore is the use of database visualizer tools. One of the tools I have begun to take a look at is SQLitebrowser. With a tool like this I will be able to do all my data analysis inside one window. Being able to see all my ideas easily on one screen will allow me to become better at queries and SQL. With the addition of a tool like this I will also be able to combine my knowledge of data analytics, specifically generating and researching statistical graphs and tables, using a tool like SQLitebrowser. While I do not have a specific file at the moment that I want to use SQL database system to perform research on I am open to a multitude of areas that include sports, cyber security, video games, and psychological data to work with.




## DBVisualizer

This is where I will paste my tutorial once I can format it correctly and get images to load :)
