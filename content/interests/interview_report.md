#### Questions



Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.


Please address the following prompts to demonstrate the feasibility of your research project idea.

1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

I will be using the tool spaCY which will comb through large amounts of data and allow me to extract key words. I will use R studio to show graphs and predictive models. I will also be using sql to organize my data base.

2. Tools: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

I will be using Python and R, and the free open source tool called spaCy to complete my project. 

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

With my knowledge of python and sql and after time spent becoming for familiar with spaCy I will be able to import my database, organzie a schema, seperate the data and extract key words that I want. With python in spacy I will be able to find key words from my data base that correlate to players and extract information that way.


4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

Yes my project is going to require existing data. I'll need to obtain player statistics in writing from a play-by-play sports site. I would like to do a seasons worth of basketball data, I think I would like to get it from one team. I would like to take key words out of the play by play to see some of the underlying stats that is not picked up my stats keepers in game. I would like to store it in a datbase that is accesable my spaCy.

5. Time: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

I anticpiate this to take the full project time, I belive obtaining and storing the data in the most efficient way will take the most time as I will most likely have to hand put in the data if I would like to use number of times a key word appears in the play by play.

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

I would like to compare actual stats to hidden stats in this project. I can test successful results and questions by comparing it to known player specialists, meaning if my data shows that a player is a scoring specialist I can compare it to the actual stats. Successful results would look like having two data bases, one for numbered statistics and one for worded statistics and then using spaCy to comb through and extract what I am looking for.

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

I would like to use rstudio to create graphs to show trends in data for either specific players or specific teams. I would also like to see if I can encorporate some predictive modeling in their to further analyze the data.

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

if this orgininal project fails I would like to keep in the area of sports analytics but maybe just change what I am analyzing.

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

I would have to check all my p-values to deem if my results are significant because there is a lot of control variables I would need to watch out for. There could be coincidences of why people perform well certain nights and why they don't other nights, and a multiude of factors in sports can affect that, which I would have to try and controll.

10. Please provide a cohesive blog post for feasibility on your website (min 200 words) to summarize your answers for the above questions.
