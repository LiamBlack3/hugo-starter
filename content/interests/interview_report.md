## Assignment 5
### Feasibility: How do-able is my project?


#### Questions
Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.

1. Who are you interviewing (the interviewee)?

Tommy Antle

2. What is the GitHub account of the interviewee?

Antlet

3. What is your interviewee's area of interest?

Python static code analysis. This includes linters, and anything that will help get bugs out of programs before you compile it.

4. Is the area of interest described clearly? (Are there seem to be clear goals for a potential research project?)

Yes the area of interest of helping other people help themseleves by find actually necessacary and beneficial tools.

5. What is your interviewee's proposal idea, in general?

To make a tool that will analyze the anlysis tool. The goal is to see which analysis tools in python are better for certain projects.

6. Is the proposal idea described clearly?

Yes idea was described very clearly to me, I am not that familier with analsys tools and he described is idea very clearly to me.

7. What are the research question(s) and/or hypothesis of the interviewee?

How can I find the necessary and only necessary static analysis tools for their program to run?

8. Does the research question(s) make sense to you, as described?

yes, the research question makes sense to me as the program is trying to find the best tools for each program.

9. What research gap does the proposed idea address?

The research gap here is that there are plently of analysis tools for python programs but we lack something that tells us which tools are right for our program. Having down many tools takes a lot of time and space to run, this tool will make analysis more efficient.

10. What supporting resources (tools, relevant literature, etc.) did the interviewee provide to demonstrate the feasibility of their idea? Briefly, describe at least three resources that they have used.
 
 Github repository of all known python analysis tools pre-compile, will draw tools from there. Python language, and tool will be created in python. External libraries will most likely have to be used in this process but are to be determined at the moment.


11. How feasible is this idea for a senior thesis? Think in terms of required knowledge, available resources, time and necessary skills to complete the various tasks of the project.

This research idea is very feasible as he has the tools necessary to complete this project. This project will be completed in 2-3 months.

12. What draw-backs can you see in your interviewee's project?

One drawback is predicting which type of programs people will use this tool for. You need to know which type of program they are trying to run to know which tool is best for them. What tools and how many are you going to be looking at?

13. What could be done to fix these drawbacks?

To fix this drawback you mentioned how looking at specific python file types would be a good way to seperate files into categories to know which tools are best for each file. Their is a repository on git hub that lists the known static analysis tools.
